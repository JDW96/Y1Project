Some of the most precise measurements of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are made through its decay into two Z bosons and then into four muons (H --> ZZ --> 4 mu). General-purpose LHC detectors like the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) have two major systems for measuring muons precisely. First, an inner tracking detector measures all charged particle paths. Second, after muons pass through the dense calorimeter system, which stops most other particles, they are identified and further measured by an outer muon detector. The unique properties of muons and the successful reconstruction of their helical paths through the magnetic fields in these detectors is what allows the Higgs to be measured precisely in the four-muon decay channel.

In this project, you will use the numpy and scipy libraries in python to build a simulation of muon paths through a detector like CMS. As you build up the complexity of this simulation, for example to account for scattering in the detector, you will also write algorithms to measure muon trajectories. You will develop an intuition for how experimental uncertainties limit muon measurement and ultimately the measurement of new properties of the Higgs. Further topics, depending on your interests, might include: identifying muon tracks amongst other particles, tracking algorithm speed, optimization of the detectorâ€™s magnetic field and overall size, and separating Higgs signal from other four-muon backgrounds.
