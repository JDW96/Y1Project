Have you ever looked at a graph of the Higgs boson mass [1] and wondered what exactly goes into it? The recent discovery of the Higgs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) included the detection of the Higgs boson decaying into two photons using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector. Given the large rate of photon pairs that come from sources other than the Higgs itself (background), the final measurement of the Higgs production rate includes complex models for the invariant mass distributions of both the Higgs signal and the backgrounds.

In this project, you will use the numpy and scipy libraries in python to build a simple simulation of the Higgs mass and background distributions. You will then write numerical models that attempt to separate signal and background in these distributions, building up the details of physical effects and experimental resolutions that allow these models to be fit accurately to the data points. Basic Higgs properties will be extracted from these models. Further topics, depending on your interest, might include: more detailed models of photons in the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter [2], investigation of new statistical techniques for background modeling developed here at Imperial [3], or predictions of the prospects for further Higgs measurements when the LHC takes higher-energy data starting this year.
